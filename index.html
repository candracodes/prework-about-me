      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an UX/UI Designer for a SAAS company based in Harrisburg, PA.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, TX, and moved to Philadelphia years ago for college. I lived and worked in Philly for 18 years and recently moved back home in January of 2020.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy art (i.e. illustration, painting, graphic design, crafting). I'm also a plant enthusiast and have over 25 plants.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Any job that allows me to be creative and "relatively" stress-free. Or being a personal shopper for Stevie Wonder (random).</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Desoto, TX</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've had a very interesting career journey. My first job out of college was a graphic design role that quickly turned into a Web Design role. I was familiar with HTML and CSS, but had no idea how to navigate PHP. That put me on a different career path where I've worked as hybrid Web Developer and Designer. I'm taking these courses to get a bit more familiar with backend technologies. I think it would help me better communicate with my colleagues during our daily standups and bi-weekly sprints.</p>
